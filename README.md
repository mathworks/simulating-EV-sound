# simulating EV sound -- Generating the sound of an electric vehicle with variable speed in Simulink®

## Overview
This Simulink model simulates the sound of an electric vehicle moving at different speed. The user can adjust a knob to simulate the sound of a vehicle running at different RPM. The algorithm is very simple and can be implemented in any processors. The code uses Audio Plugins in Simulink (https://www.mathworks.com/help/audio/ug/audio-plugin-example-gallery.html).
